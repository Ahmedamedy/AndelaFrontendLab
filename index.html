					<h3><b>Third Day at Boot Camp</b></h3>
					<p> The Andela exercises are intense although, I’m gladly managing. 
					I have so far managed to submit all the assignments and received my first scorecard. 
					The scorecards had mixed remarks. I was both commended and politely and positively criticized by my facilitator. 
					All in all, I need to improve and that’s why I trying to join Andela.
					I’m enjoying sharing knowledge with other the boot campers especially when we come together to share ideas on the toughest exercises.</p>

					<h3><b>My Experience At Boot Camp so far</b></h3>
					<p> Yesterday was my first day at the Andela bootcamp and I had a captivating and interesting experience. 
					I had to wake up earlier than usual to help my wife pack since she was travelling for a conference in Mombasa 
					and the company driver was coming to pick her at 7.00 am.
					I got married last year and it was the first time we were going to be away from each other. 
					It was hard for both of us but I knew I needed some alone time without any distractions because of the daunting task 
					than I was anticipating from Andela. I helped her pack and within no time the driver had arrived and she was off</p>

					<h3><b>Learning Digital Marketing</b></h3>
					<p> A few months back, I was given a task by my Boss to assist our marketing department in digital marketing. 
					A task I was basically new to and knew nothing about. My Boss didn’t clarify exactly what exactly he wanted like most bosses, 
					but I knew in he just wanted new marketing position through technology platforms.
					I knew about google ads and that was my idea of digital marketing and that’s what I started working on. 
					One week down the line, he called me to his office for feedback.</p>
